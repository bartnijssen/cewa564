    "These demos assume that you have some basic knowledge of python and Jupyter notebooks, because we will be using a python package called `pysumma` to manipulate SUMMA simulations. If that is not the case, then start with learning a little bit about python and Jupyter notebooks. Excellent resources for this exist online. One place to start is [this tutorial](http://python.berkeley.edu/learn/) from Python Practice at Berkeley, but there are many others. \n",

    "... (standing by while you are learning python, etc.) ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to access the virtual machine and have gone through some Jupyter and python tutorials, let's move to the real topic of this course, which is hydrological modeling. In Demo 1 you will run through a number of exercises using SUMMA as your hydrology model. You will interact with SUMMA using a python module called `pysumma` using model configurations that I will provide for you. One of the nice things about running all this using the cloud instances provided by [Pangio](http://pangeo.io/) is that you don't need to install anything locally and that you only need access to a web browser. All the software that you will need to run the exercises is pre-installed in this virtual machine.\n",

    "You will want to save your notebooks in a place other than the `cewa564` directory tree, because files you save there may be deleted and overwritten when you update your git repository. In the following, I will assume that you create a `work` directory in your `home` directory (so `/home/jovyan/work`) and that you will save your copies of these notebooks there. So before you continue, create a `work` directory (if there isn't one) and save this file somewhere in that `work` directory tree: `work/demos` would be a great place for them. So click on \"_File --> Save Notebook As..._\" and save this notebook as `work/demos/demo_1_a_introduction.ipynb` before you continue. If things go hopelessly wrong, you can always start over again with the original notebook in your `cewa564` directory tree."

The code for the `pysumma` is available on their [GitHub site](https://github.com/uva-hydroinformatics/pysumma).
